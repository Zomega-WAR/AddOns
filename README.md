# AddOns

User interface add-ons for Warhammer Online that I have either created or currently maintain. Official releases can usually be found at https://tools.idrinth.de/addons/.

Add-ons folders that begin with "(DEMO)" are just small proof-of-concept add-ons intented to demonstrate (demo) a feature or idea and are not intended to be used in normal gameplay.

The "(MACROS)" folder is just a collection of one-line macros that don't really need their own dedicated add-on.
