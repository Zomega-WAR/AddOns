# (DEMO) Line To Target

Demonstration/proof-of-concept add-on that draws a textured scrolling line between a fixed point and the current friendly target that only needs a single window for the line (plus one additional window for an anchor point). Currently used versions are implemented with multiple line segments which is less performant than just using one window per textured line.

Original version used the line texture from GuardPack/Teather. In this version I have replaced it with a new texture made by me so I can license the whole thing.

Add-on not intended for normal gameplay.
